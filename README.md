## **Background and Overview**

Born out of the coronavirus pandemic, the idea behind Profferly started with the recognized need for lending hands. Whether itâ€™s an at-risk person needing a volunteer to grab them groceries during lockdown, or an outreach program needing a group of volunteers to help run their event for the day, Profferly is about connecting opportunities with those who can serve to ultimately strengthen the bonds of community.

## **Architecture and Technologies**

Profferly was built using:

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- React Hooks
- Node
- AWS S3
- Google Maps API
- Socket&#46;IO
- SCSS and CSS

## **Overview**

- **Create your profile.** Sign up to become a volunteer, or to provide volunteering opportunities.
- **Post.** Post a picture from your event or spread some feel good volunteering inspo on the Profferly wall.
- **Pin a Marker.** Locate pinned volunteering opportunities near you or create a pin on the Profferly map so that others nearby can view your event.
- **Chat.** Have a live chat with fellow volunteers or organization leaders to discuss the necessary details.

## **Features**

### Full User Authentication

---

Users can sign up to create an account and then use the same credentials to sign-in. On the front end, required fields are checked for presence errors and are displayed accordingly. Passwords are hashed using BCrypt to ensure security and users will remain signed in even if they leave the site. A demo user has been created so that those who may wish can preview Profferly before signing up.

### Google Maps API

---

The roadmap implmented via Google Maps API allows users to not only view local pinned events, but also to create them.

To pin a marker for your event or cause, click on the location on the map to activate the marker modal. Then, fill in the required information and submit. A full screen map may be accessed by clicking the globe icon in the top navigation bar, located between the user's profile link and the log out button.

### Real-Time Live Chat

---

Users can create a new chat room or join an existing one to chat with others as Socket&#46;IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communcation.

When a new socket instance has been connected to the chat room, the admin greets the the entering user by emitting both a welcome message and a notification that said user has joined. A count of users in each chat room is also kept, so that users can see a live count of who is in the same room.

Chat rooms may be accessed by clicking the chat icon in the bottom right hand corner of the app.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

```javascript
io.on("connect", (socket) => {
  socket.on("join", ({ name, room }, callback) => {
    const { error, user } = addUser({ id: socket.id, name, room });
    if (error) return callback(error);
    socket.join(user.room);
    socket.emit("message", {
       user: "admin",
       text: `${user.name}, welcome to ${user.room}`,
     });
    socket.emit("id", socket.id);
    socket.broadcast
       .to(user.room)
       .emit("message", { user: "admin", text: `${user.name} has joined!` });
    const arr = getUsersInRoom(user.room);
    const items = arr.filter(function (elem, pos) {
      return arr.indexOf(elem) == pos;
    });
    io.to(user.room).emit("roomData", {
      room: user.room,
      users: items,
    });
    callback();
  });
```
